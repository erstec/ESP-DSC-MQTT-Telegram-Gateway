/**
   When using ESP32 with the Arduino IDE, it does not support the native watchdog timer.
   The following watchdog implementation does not use the official watchdog timer
   but employs a normal timer to reset the CPU if wdt_reset() is not called in time.
   Inspired by the following discussion:
   https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/issues/841
